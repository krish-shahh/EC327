If Statements:

- if(predicate) \{\}

- Can be chained (very bad code)

- Can be Nested (also bad code)

- Try to use logic operators when you can to break up and reduce number of if statements

Switch statements:

- Switch (expression)

- expression must evaluate to an integer

- Can have multiple cases and then have a default statement

- use "break" statement if you want the switch to stop.

- Ex:

- Case 0: ...

- Case 1: ...

- Case 2: ...

- default: ... LOOpS:

- while(predicate) \{\}

- do \{\} while(predicate) - executes code in braces at least once and then does while loop

- for(initial; condition; post) \{\} (you can also put a "break" in a for statement - makes it jump to the end of the loop) ("continue" stops the current inner loop and go through the next iteration of the loop)

- foreach

Streams:

- cout $<<$ "hello" $<<3<<$ endl;

- $\operatorname{cin} \gg x>y$

- ofstream output

- out.open("foo.txt");

- output $<<95<$ "hi" $<<$ endl;

- flush buffer by doing output.close() or doing $<<$ flush at the at the end of the line above

- ifstream input

- input.open(" ");

- input $>>$

- input.close()

Functions:

- Used to avoid rewriting code

- The goal is to write the fewest line of code

- Abstract details - Get bigger picture

- returnType functionName (list of parameters) \{ implementation of function

\}

- function signature does not include returnType. Used by Parser

- void returnType $=$ procedure meaning it does return any value

Stack:

- LIFO data structure (Last in, First out)

Heap:

- Place to store extra information
